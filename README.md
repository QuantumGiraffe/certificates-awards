Scrimba is a self-guided course that teaches the skills necessary to become a frontend developer. It took me 300+ hours to finish this course. It teaches CSS, HTML, JavaScript, React.js, and Responsive web design. After finishing this course, I had enough skills to build my own website and create personal projects including React apps.
