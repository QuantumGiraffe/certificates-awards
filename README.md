Certificates and Awards from courses and organizations I have earned

Scrimba is a self-guided course that teaches the skills necessary to become a frontend developer. This is the description directly from their website:

"This career path will turn you into a hireable frontend developer, and teach you how to nail the job interview. It contains over 70 hours of top-notch tutorials, hundreds of coding challenges, and dozens of real-world projects. The program contains 15 modules. All modules are filled with interactive coding challenges to ensure that you don't fall off the wagon. You'll learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, UI design, career strategy, and more."

The course took me a long time because I took notes on all of the modules and tried to finish every challenge as best I could. It taught me the skills to build my own website and make fun, rewarding personal projects.

In 2020 during my last semester of college I worked on a project with my professor analyzing LiDAR data using ArcGIS tools to map stonewalls in New England. My contributions helped expand a data set that was being used by grad students to help write their theses
